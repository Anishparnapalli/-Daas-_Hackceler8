📌 Project Title
VisionAi – AI-powered Object Detection Web App
(AI-powered real-time object detection using COCO-SSD & MobileNet models in TensorFlow.js)

🧩 Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced world, there is a need for real-time, lightweight, and accessible AI tools that can detect and classify objects instantly without requiring heavy hardware or installations.

Current solutions are complex or costly.

Many don’t run directly in browsers or mobile devices.

Lack of accessibility for students, developers, and researchers.

💡 Solution

Our solution is VisionAi, a browser-based object detection system that:

Runs directly in the browser (no software installation).

Uses TensorFlow.js with COCO-SSD & MobileNet models.

Detects objects in real time via webcam or uploaded images.

Has a clean dark UI with history tracking & settings.
